Hi guys!!! Welcome to my test website! 

## About me

I'm a Chinese student who studying data science at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html). 
My favorite animal is the dog, and I have a lovely Chihuahua.
I also like to use interesting emojis in chat to improve the fun of communication, because they can better show the feelings I want to express.

## I also love memes!

Below is a meme I made using the R package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).

I used my life experience to apply this meme and used my favorite Chihuahua as the protagonist.

I also probably should provide the `R` code I used to make the meme!
